With only two free parameters, which are fixed by the zero-temperature nuclear properties, the-model reproduces well experimental GDR cross sections in the 100 ≤ A ≤ 170 mass range for both spherical and deformed nuclei. We also investigate the cross-section systematics as a function of both temperature and angular velocity and the sensitivity of the GDR peak to the nuclear shape. We conclude that at low temperatures (T ≈ 1 MeVfs) the GDR cross section is sensitive to changes in the nuclear energy surface. Higher-temperature (T ≳ 2 MeV) cross sections are dominated by large fluctuations (triaxial in particular) and are much less sensitive to the equilibrium shape.</small>

It provides a uniform description of thermal fluctuations in all quadrupole shape degrees of freedom within the framework of the Landau theory. In particular, the inclusion of fluctuations in the nuclear orientation with respect to the rotation axis is crucial in reproducing the observed attenuation of the angular anisotropy. The theory is applied to recent precision measurements in 90Zr and 92Mo and is the first to reproduce well both the observed giant-dipole-resonance cross sections and the angular anisotropies.</small>

Using the framework of the Landau theory of shape transitions we develop a realistic macroscopic stochastic model to describe the quadrupole time-dependent shape fluctuations and their coupling to the dipole degrees of freedom. In the adiabatic limit the theory reduces to a previous adiabatic theory of static fluctuations in which the GDR cross section is calculated by averaging over the equilibrium distribution with the unitary invariant metric. Nonadiabatic effects are investigated in this model and found to cause structural changes in the resonance cross section and motional narrowing. Comparisons with experimental data are made and deviations from the adiabatic calculations can be explained. In these cases it is possible to determine from the data the damping of the quadrupole motion at finite temperature.</small>

Using the framework of the Landau theory of shape transitions, both the quadrupole shape and the giant dipole degrees of freedom are described by a coupled set of stochastic equations. Two solvable models for which the dipole correlation function is found in closed form are discussed; one for a spherical nucleus and one for a deformed nucleus. The adiabatic and sudden limits of the models are examined. The latter limit is shown to produce a phenomenon known as motional narrowing. For the more general cases we introduce Monte Carlo techniques and test them against the solvable models.</small>

The effects of thermal shape fluctuation and in particular fluctuations in the nuclear orientation with respect to the rotation axis, are discussed in the framework of the Landau theory. It is found that while orientation fluctuations have negligible effects on the GDR cross section, they cause significant attenuation in the angular anisotropy parameter a2 which offsets the a2 enhancement due to intrinsic shape fluctuations. It is shown that this fluctuation theory is successful in reproducing both the observed cross section and a2 in highly excited 90Zr and 92Mo compound nuclei. The non-adiabatic effects on a2 are studied in terms of a time-dependent model for the quadrupole shape fluctuations.</small>

Comparing the SPA level density to the MFA one, we find an enhancement with a great sensitivity to the interaction strength, in agreement with exact analytic results. This enhancement compensates for a corresponding suppression which occurs at negative temperatures. The saddle-point approximation used in converting the partition function to the level density works well at all but low energies.</small>

With all parameters fixed by the zero-temperature nuclear properties the theory shows a very good agreement with existing GDR measurements in hot nuclei. The sensitivity of the GDR peak to the shape of hot nuclei is critically examined. Low-temperature experimental results in Er show clear evidence for changes in the nuclear energy surface, while higher-temperature results are dominated by the fluctuations.</small>

When expressed in units of the spherical width, this width reduces to a purely geometrical elliptic integral. It is shown to be very well approximated by the empirical power law with an exponent of 1.6. This approach utilizes no free parameters and reproduces the experimentally observed width dependence for GDR’s built on the ground state of heavy nuclei. The formula derived here plays an important role in a recently developed macroscopic approach to the GDR in hot rotating nuclei.</small>

This new theory provides a natural covariant microscopic approach that includes automatically spacetime nonlocality and retardation, nonequilibrium phenomena, interactions among all nucleons and particle production. In the current version of our theory, we consider N extended unexcited nucleons interacting with massive neutral scalar (σ) and neutral vector (ω) meson fields. The resulting classical relativistic many-body equations of motion are solved numerically without further approximation for soft nucleon-nucleon collisions at plab = 14.6, 30, 60, 100 and 200 GeV/c to yield the transverse momentum imparted to the nucleons. For the future development of the theory, the isovector pseudoscalar (π+, π−, π0), isovector scalar (δ+, δ−, δ0), isovector vector (ϱ+, ϱ−, ϱ0) and neutral pseudoscalar (η) meson fields that are known to be important from nucleon-nucleon scattering experiments should be incorporated.

B. W. Bush and J. R. Nix, “New Approach to the Interaction of Cosmic Rays with Nuclei in Spacecraft Shielding and the Human Body,” Los Alamos National Laboratory, Report LA-12452-MS. <br /><small>The interaction of high-energy cosmic rays with nuclei in spacecraft shielding and the human body is important for manned interplanetary missions and is not well understood either experimentally or theoretically. We present a new theoretical approach to this problem based on classical hadrodynamics for extended nucleons, which treats nucleons of finite size interacting with massive meson fields. This theory represents the classical analogue of the quantum hadrodynamics of Serot and Walecka without the assumptions of the mean-field approximation and point nucleons. It provides a natural covariant microscopic approach to collisions between cosmic rays and nuclei that automatically includes space-time non-locality and retardation, nonequilibrium phenomena, interactions among all nucleons, and particle production. Unlike previous models, this approach is manifestly Lorentz covariant and satisfies a priori the basic conditions that are present when cosmic rays collide with nuclei, namely an interaction time that is extremely short and a nucleon mean-free path, force range, and internucleon separation that are all comparable in size. We review the history of classical meson-field theory and derive the classical relativistic equations of motion for nucleons of finite size interacting with massive scalar and vector meson fields.</small>

This mechanism is described within the framework of classical hadrodynamics for extended nucleons, corresponding to nucleons of finite size interacting with massive meson fields. This new theory provides a natural covariant microscopic approach to relativistic heavy-ion collisions that includes automatically spacetime nonlocality and retardation, nonequilibrium phenomena, interactions among all nucleons, and particle production. Inclusion of the finite nucleon size cures the difficulties with preacceleration and runaway solutions that have plagued the classical theory of self-interacting point particles. For the soft reactions that dominate nucleon-nucleon collisions, a significant fraction of the incident center-of-mass energy is radiated through massive bremsstrahlung. In the present version of the theory, this radiated energy is in the form of neutral scalar (σ) and neutral vector (ω) mesons, which subsequently decay primarily into pions with some photons also. Additional meson fields that are known to be important from nucleon-nucleon scattering experiments should be incorporated in the future, in which case the radiated energy would also contain isovector pseudoscalar (π+, π–, π0), isovector scalar (δ+, δ–, δ0), isovector vector (ρ+, ρ–, ρ0), and neutral pseudoscalar (η) mesons.</small>

The equations of motion contain both external retarded Lorentz forces and radiation-reaction forces; the latter involve nonlocal terms that depend upon the past history of the nucleon in addition to terms analogous to those of classical electrodynamics. The resulting microscopic many-body approach to relativistic heavy-ion collisions is manifestly Lorentz covariant and allows for nonequilibrium phenomena, interactions with correlated clusters of nucleons, and particle production. For point nucleons, the asymptotic behavior of nucleonic motion prior to the collision is exponential, with a range in proper time of approximately 0.5 fm. However, this behavior is altered by the finite nucleon size, whose effect we are currently incorporating into our equations of motion. The spacetime nonlocality and retardation that will be present in the solutions of these equations may be responsible for significant collective effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</small>

The results show a large deformation (|β| ∼ 0.51±0.29 and 0.35±0.14) for the angular-momentum regions with 〈J〉 ∼ 32h̵ at T ≈ 1.8±0.2 MeV and 〈J〉 ∼ 46h̵ at T ≈ 1.7±0.2 MeV, respectively, in satisfactory agreement with calculations performed in the framework of Landau theory of shape transitions and statistical fluctuations. The deduced centroid energies are in agreement with the systematics of the GDR built on the ground state. The width of the GDR shows a systematic increase with increasing temperature.</small>
