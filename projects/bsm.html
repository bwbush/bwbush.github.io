        <h1>Biomass Scenario Model [BSM]</h1>
        <p>The Biomass Scenario Model [BSM] is a unique, carefully validated, state-of-the-art dynamic model of the domestic biofuels supply chain which explicitly focuses on policy issues, their feasibility, and potential side effects. It integrates resource availability, physical/technological/economic constraints, behavior, and policy. The model uses a system dynamics simulation (not optimization) to model dynamic interactions across the supply chain. The BSM tracks the deployment of biofuels given current technological development and the reaction of the investment community to those technologies. It emphasizes the effects of those influences in the context of land availability, the competing oil market, consumer demand for biofuels, and government policies over time. It has a strong emphasis on the behavior and decision making of various agents and resolves ten geographic regions domestically. The BSM is currently used to develop insights into the biofuels industry growth and market penetration, particularly with respect to policies and incentives (volumetric, capital, operating subsidies; carbon caps/taxes; R&amp;D investment; loan guarantees; tax credits) applicable to each supply-chain element. It is suitable for coupling to vehicle-choice, agricultural, oil-industry, and general economic models.</p>

It integrates resource availability, behavior, policy, and physical, technological, and economic constraints. The model uses a system-dynamics simulation (not optimization) to model dynamic interactions across the supply chain; the BSM tracks the deployment of biofuels given technological development and the reaction of the investment community to those technologies in the context of land availability, the competing oil market, consumer demand for biofuels, and government policies over time. It places a strong emphasis on the behavior and decision-making of various economic agents among ten geographic regions domestically. The BSM has been used to develop insights into biofuels industry growth and market penetration, particularly with respect to policies and incentives applicable to each supply-chain element (volumetric, capital, operating subsidies; carbon caps/taxes; R&amp;D investment; loan guarantees; tax credits); the model treats the major infrastructure-compatible fuels such as biomass-based gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, ethanol, and butanol. In general, scenario analysis based on the BSM shows that the biofuels industry tends not to rapidly thrive without significant external actions in the early years of its evolution. An initial focus for jumpstarting the industry typically has strongest results in the BSM in areas where effects of intervention have been identified to be multiplicative: due to industrial learning dynamics, support for the construction of biofuel conversion facilities in the near future encourages the industry to flourish. In general, we find that policies which are coordinated across the whole supply chain have significant impact in fostering the growth of the biofuels industry and that the production of tens of billions of gallons of biofuels may occur under sufficiently favorable conditions.</small>

Achieving such large scale biofuels adoption requires substantial development of new infrastructure, markets, and related systems. The U.S. Department of Energy is employing a system dynamics model, the Biomass Scenario Model (BSM), to represent the primary system effects and dependencies in the biomass-to-biofuels supply chain and to provide a framework for developing scenarios and conducting biofuels policy analysis. This approach is designed to help focus government action by determining which supply chain changes would have the greatest potential to accelerate the deployment of biofuels. Modeling the integration of all aspects of the supply chain from growing the feedstock through harvest, collection, transport, conversion, distribution of fuel and finally consumption of the fuel in applicable vehicles (including the availability of these vehicles) is critical to understanding where government funds might be utilized most effectively. This presentation provides an overview of the status of the BSM and a summary of recent results from system analysis based on it. We find that policies which are coordinated across the whole supply chain have significant impact in fostering the growth of the biofuels industry.</small>

Lett.</em>, vol. 8, no. 2, p. 025016. &lt;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/025016">http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/025016</a>&gt;<br /><small>Biofuels are expected to be a major contributor to renewable energy in the coming decades under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). These fuels have many attractive properties including the promotion of energy independence, rural development, and the reduction of national carbon emissions. However, several unresolved environmental and economic concerns remain. Environmentally, much of the biomass is expected to come from agricultural expansion and/or intensification, which may greatly affect the net environmental impact, and economically, the lack of a developed infrastructure and bottlenecks along the supply chain may affect the industry’s economic vitality. The approximately 30 million acres (12 million hectares) under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) represent one land base for possible expansion. Here, we examine the potential role of the CRP in biofuels industry development, by (1) assessing the range of environmental effects on six end points of concern, and (2) simulating differences in potential industry growth nationally using a systems dynamics model. The model examines seven land-use scenarios (various percentages of CRP cultivation for biofuel) and five economic scenarios (subsidy schemes) to explore the benefits of using the CRP. The environmental assessment revealed wide variation in potential impacts. Lignocellulosic feedstocks had the greatest potential to improve the environmental condition relative to row crops, but the most plausible impacts were considered to be neutral or slightly negative. Model simulations revealed that industry growth was much more sensitive to economic scenarios than land-use scenarios—similar volumes of biofuels could be produced with no CRP as with 100% utilization. The range of responses to economic policy was substantial, including long-term market stagnation at current levels of first-generation biofuels under minimal policy intervention, or RFS-scale quantities of biofuels if policy or market conditions were more favorable. In total, the combination of the environmental assessment and the supply chain model suggests that large-scale conversion of the CRP to row crops would likely incur a significant environmental cost, without a concomitant benefit in terms of biofuel production.</small>

The BSM is a complex model that has been used for extensive analyses; the model and its results can be better understood if input data used for initialization and calibration are well-characterized. It has been carefully validated and calibrated against the available data, with data gaps filled in using expert opinion and internally consistent assumed values. Most of the main data sources that feed into the model are recognized as baseline values by the industry. This report documents data sources and references in Version 2 of the BSM (BSM2), which only contains the ethanol pathway, although subsequent versions of the BSM contain multiple conversion pathways. The BSM2 contains over 12,000 total input values, with 506 distinct variables. Many of the variables are opportunities for the user to define scenarios, while others are simply used to initialize a stock, such as the initial number of biorefineries. However, around 35% of the distinct variables are defined by external sources, such as models or reports. The focus of this report is to provide insight into which sources are most influential in each area of the supply chain. We find that data based on POLYSYS datasets and U.S. Department of Agriculture baseline projections are the most utilized sources in the feedstock sector, whereas the conversion module relies heavily on data found in National Renewable Energy Laboratory technical reports dealing with the techno-economic characteristics of different technologies. The distribution, dispensing, and fuel use modules utilize data on gasoline stations from the National Association of Convenience Stores.</small>

However, it does not currently have the capability to account for allocation of biomass resources among the various end uses, which limits its utilization in analysis of policies that target biomass uses outside the biofuels industry. This report provides a more holistic understanding of the dynamics surrounding the allocation of biomass among uses that include traditional use, wood pellet exports, bio-based products and bioproducts, biopower, and biofuels by (1) highlighting the methods used in existing models’ treatments of competition for biomass resources; (2) identifying coverage and gaps in industry data regarding the competing end uses; and (3) exploring options for developing models of biomass allocation that could be integrated with the BSM to actively exchange and incorporate relevant information</small>

A. dos Santos Bernardes, Ed. Rijeka, Croatia: InTech, pp. 373–404. &lt;<a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/economic-effects-of-biofuel-production/understanding-the-developing-cellulosic-biofuels-industry-through-dynamic-modeling">http://www.intechopen.com/books/economic-effects-of-biofuel-production/understanding-the-developing-cellulosic-biofuels-industry-through-dynamic-modeling</a>&gt;<br /><small>Biofuels are promoted in the United States through aggressive legislation, as one part of an overall strategy to lessen dependence on imported energy as well as to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases (Office of the Biomass Program and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 2008). For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandates 36 billion gallons of renewable liquid transportation fuel in the U.S. marketplace by the year 2022 (U.S. Government, 2007). Meeting such large volumetric targets has prompted an unprecedented increase in funding for biofuels research. Language in the EISA legislation limits the amount of renewable fuel derived from starch-based feedstocks (which are already established and feed the commercially viable ethanol industry in the United States); therefore, much of the current research is focused on producing ethanol—but from cellulosic feedstocks. These feedstocks, such as agricultural and forestry residues, perennial grasses, woody crops, and municipal solid wastes, are advantageous because they do not necessarily compete directly with food, feed, and fiber production and are envisaged to require fewer inputs (e.g., water, nutrients, and land) as compared to corn and other commodity crops. In order to help propel the biofuels industry in general and the cellulosic ethanol industry in particular, the U.S. government has enacted subsidies, fixed capital investment grants, loan guarantees, vehicle choice credits, and aggressive corporate average fuel economy standards as incentives. However, the effect of these policies on the cellulosic ethanol industry over time is not well understood. Policies such as those enacted in the United States, that are intended to incentivize the industry and promote industrial expansion, can have profound long-term effects on growth and industry takeoff as well as interact with other policies in unforeseen ways (both negative and positive). Qualifying the relative efficacies of incentive strategies could potentially lead to faster industry growth as well as optimize the government’s investment in policies to promote renewable fuels. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss a system dynamics model called the Biomass Scenario Model (BSM), which is being developed by the U.S. Department of Energy as a tool to better understand the interaction of complex policies and their potential effects on the burgeoning cellulosic biofuels industry in the United States. The model has also recently been expanded to include advanced conversion technologies and biofuels (i.e., conversion pathways that yield biomass-based gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and butanol), but we focus on cellulosic ethanol conversion pathways here. The BSM uses a system dynamics modeling approach (Bush et al., 2008) built on the STELLA software platform (isee systems, 2010) to model the entire biomass-to-biofuels supply chain. Key components of the BSM are shown in Figure 1. In addition to describing the underpinnings of this model, we will share insights that have been gleaned from a myriad of scenario- and policy-driven model runs. These insights will focus on how roadblocks, bottlenecks, and incentives all work in concert to have profound effects on the future of the industry.</small>

Meeting mandated volumetric targets has prompted substantial funding for biofuels research, much of it focused on producing ethanol and other fuel types from biomass feedstocks. A variety of incentive programs (including subsidies, fixed capital investment grants, loan guarantees, vehicle choice credits, and aggressive corporate average fuel economy standards)have been developed, but their short-and long-term ramifications are not well known. This paper describes the Biomass Scenario Model, a system dynamics model developed under the support of the U.S. Department of Energy as the result of a multi-year project at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The model represents multiple pathways leading to the production of fuel ethanol as well as advanced biofuels such as biomass-based gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and butanol). This paper details the BSM system dynamics architecture, the design of the supporting database infrastructure, the associated scenario libraries used in model runs, as well as key insights resulting from BSM simulations and analyses.</small>

Peterson, “Ethanol Distribution, Dispensing, and Use: Analysis of a Portion of the Biomass-to-Biofuels Supply Chain Using System Dynamics,” <em>PLoS ONE</em>, vol. 7, no. 5, p. e35082. &lt;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035082">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035082</a>&gt;<br /><small>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 targets use of 36 billion gallons of biofuels per year by 2022. Achieving this may require substantial changes to current transportation fuel systems for distribution, dispensing, and use in vehicles. The U.S. Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory designed a system dynamics approach to help focus government action by determining what supply chain changes would have the greatest potential to accelerate biofuels deployment. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed the Biomass Scenario Model, a system dynamics model which represents the primary system effects and dependencies in the biomass-to-biofuels supply chain. The model provides a framework for developing scenarios and conducting biofuels policy analysis. This paper focuses on the downstream portion of the supply chain–represented in the distribution logistics, dispensing station, and fuel utilization, and vehicle modules of the Biomass Scenario Model. This model initially focused on ethanol, but has since been expanded to include other biofuels. Some portions of this system are represented dynamically with major interactions and feedbacks, especially those related to a dispensing station owner’s decision whether to offer ethanol fuel and a consumer’s choice whether to purchase that fuel. Other portions of the system are modeled with little or no dynamics; the vehicle choices of consumers are represented as discrete scenarios. This paper explores conditions needed to sustain an ethanol fuel market and identifies implications of these findings for program and policy goals. A large, economically sustainable ethanol fuel market (or other biofuel market) requires low end-user fuel price relative to gasoline and sufficient producer payment, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Other requirements (different for ethanol vs. other biofuel markets) include the need for infrastructure for distribution and dispensing and widespread use of high ethanol blends in flexible-fuel vehicles.</small>
