        <h1>Risk Analysis of Renewable Energy Investments</h1>
        <p>The focus of this project is on gaining a better understanding of the potential variance-related benefits (or disadvantages) of using renewable energy such as wind relative to natural gas generation, including the visualization of such behavior. Specifically, we explored the effect of wind energy and natural gas technologies on the variance of producer and consumer surplus, measured respectively in terms of profits (e.g., annualized returns) or monthly consumer costs ($/kWh). This work differs from a number of other studies in several ways by using hourly historical information over a 10 year period (1999 to 2008) to estimate returns and costs, and their variance for both the producer and the consumer, respectively, under the two most common alternative market structure scenarios (i) deregulation and (ii) “cost-plus” regulation.</p>
<p>We were interested in understanding differences in expected value and variance of net returns and costs experienced by producers and consumers in a given market structure, and how this changes with market structure assumptions. The analysis looks at several timeframes (e.g., monthly consumer cost of energy [$/MWh-month], annualized producer returns) using hourly dispatch information. Using historical price data in an empirical analysis of cost/price variance nicely complements forward-looking analytic and Monte Carlo studies of electricity production portfolios in that it accounts for the non-normal distributions and the complex correlations in time and between energy commodities in a manner that is not typically or easily represented in simple forward-looking models. A secondary goal of this project is to consider the value and limitations of various simple aggregated representations of risk and reward, and how this is impacted by non-normal asymmetric distributions.</p>
