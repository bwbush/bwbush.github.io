        <h2>Interdependent Energy Infrastructure Simulation System [IEISS]</h2>
        <p>The primary function of IEISS [Interdependent Energy Infrastructure Simulation System] is to enable homeland security analysts and decision makers to understand and accurately assess intrinsic vulnerabilities in critical US infrastructures and those vulnerabilities that result from other forms of attack. It provides a high-quality, flexible, and extensible actor-based approach that has been used for</p>
<ul>
<li>analyzing interdependent infrastructures;</li>
<li>understanding and answering questions of importance to homeland security such as identifying potential events that cause catastrophic system failure;</li>
<li>developing policy procedures that will aid in the prevention of physical terrorism.</li>

Los Alamos National Laboratory. <br /><small>The IEISS software models energy transmission network systems (such as electric power systems and natural gas pipelines) and simulates their physical behavior, including the interdependencies between systems (such as when the energy supplied by one system is used to operate components of another system). Each physical, logical, or functional entity in the model has a variety of attributes and behaviors that mimic its real-world counterpart. The software supports the analysis of the complex, non-linear, and emergent interactions between energy infrastructures at the state, regional, or national scale. (Databases are not supplied with the software, however.) Specifically, the simulation can be used to visualize the interconnectivity between different energy systems, predict the outcome of incidents affecting the networks, measure the economic effects of disruptions in service, assess system robustness under varied future plans and forecasts, and identify components critical for the operation of the systems.</small>

Giguere, “Modeling of Interdependent Infrastructures,” in <em>Probabilistic safety assessment and management (PSAM6) : proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management, 23-28 June 2002, San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA</em>, San Juan, Puerto Rico. <br /><small>An actor-based modeling methodology is used to simulate interactions among interdependent commercial infrastructures. The goal of this method is to capture the complex, nonlinear, self-organizing, emergent, and sometimes chaotic behaviors and interactions exemplified by complex systems, rather than relying on traditional aggregate mathematical and simulation techniques. A prototype model of four interdependent infrastructures was considered as an example. The actor-based definitions of the electric-power transmission line and natural-gas pipeline networks were developed to realistically simulate the dynamic interactions within each of these infrastructures and the interactions and interdependencies between these two infrastructures. A three-dimensional representation of system components and interconnectivity was developed. The visualization is an interactive, three-dimensional, geographically based, “layered” view of infrastructure interdependencies. It also links to a geographic information system for data analysis. A unique iterative natural-gas network solver algorithm was developed. Our assessment shows that a hybrid approach using an actor-based definition of infrastructure components in conjunction with iterative and commercial solvers has great promise for addressing the operation of interdependent infrastructures in a restructured and deregulated environment.</small>

IEISS is an actor-based infrastructure modeling, simulation, and analysis tool designed to assist individuals in analyzing and understanding interdependent energy infrastructures. In particular, it has the ability to analyze and simulate the interdependent electric power and natural gas infrastructures. The ultimate goal for IEISS is a multi-infrastructure modeling framework that can be used to analyze the complex, nonlinear interactions among interdependent infrastructures including electric power, natural gas, petroleum, water, and other network based infrastructures that is scalable to multiple spatial (e.g., urban to regional) and temporal resolutions. The actor-based infrastructure components were developed in IEISS to realistically simulate the dynamic interactions within each of the infrastructures, as well as, the interconnections between the infrastructures. To enhance its capabilities, a generalized fluid network will be added to the infrastructure framework, which will allow for the analysis of specific fluid infrastructures (e.g., water, petroleum, oil, etc.). In this research, we describe the extension of IEISS to include water infrastructure. The resulting simulation capability (i.e., IEISS Water) will allow the simulation of transmission/distribution-level water systems in terms of infrastructure specific vulnerabilities and interdependent infrastructure vulnerabilities (e.g., power and water disruptions).</small>
