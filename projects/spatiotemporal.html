       	     <h1>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Renewable Energy Datasets</h1>
	
       	     <p>The primary thrust of this project was to investigate whether geostatistical techniques can be used productively to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of renewable energy production and load data, for use as inputs to grid integration models. Specifically, we used mapping techniques to predict solar output at subhourly resolution at any spatial point (disaggregation and extrapolation) or region. To assess the electric power grid environment under high penetrations of wind, CSP, and solar PV for any location in the southwest United States, solar resource estimates in several-minute time steps are required for any desired location. Typical measured solar radiation or PV output data is spatially sparse but temporally dense (1–10 minute time resolution), whereas satellite-based (modeled) PV data is spatially dense (typically a 10 km grid) but temporally sparse (typically hourly). These data sets must be combined to create an improved estimate of PV output for the desired locations and times. The accuracy of the estimated data must be established, and if this accuracy is not adequate for the desired application, sites should be identified for new measurement stations. These goals were accomplished by using geostatistics and atmospheric science to estimate solar PV output. In addition to handling a mixture of spatial and temporal resolutions, modern geostatistics also self-consistently melds “hard” (accurate) and “soft” (lower accuracy) data into reconstructions that include data uncertainty sources (i.e., modeled data inaccuracy and classification of atmospheric variables).</p>
