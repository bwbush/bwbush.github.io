<h3 id="biographical-sketch">Biographical Sketch</h3>
<p>Brian W. Bush is a Principal Engineer in the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/staff_efm.html">Energy Forecasting &amp; Modeling Group</a> of the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/about_office.html">Strategic Energy Analysis Center</a> at the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory [NREL]</a>. He currently leads NREL’s <a href="projects/bsm.html">Biomass Scenario Model [BSM] project</a>, a system-dynamics simulation of the cellulosic biomass-to-biofuels supply chain, and its <a href="projects/sera.html">Scenario Evaluation and Regionalization Analysis [SERA] project</a>, an optimization tool for regional hydrogen infrastructure. He has also led and collaborated on projects focused on numerous data-science and data-engineering projects such as the geostatistical modeling and analysis of the spatial and temporal correlations in renewable energy resources, automated anomaly detection and correction in energy datasets, and logical reasoning on qualitative semi-structured databases. He is a member of NREL’s Research Council.</p>
<p>For more than seventeen years prior to his arrival at NREL, he was a technical staff member in the Energy and Infrastructure Analysis Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory [LANL]. His work on <a href="projects/transims.html">TRANSIMS [the Transportation Analysis Simulation System]</a> from 1994 to 2000 there focused on leading research on software architecture, the representation of road networks, microsimulation output collection, and data compression. More recently, he developed computer simulations for complex phenomena such as <a href="projects/infrastructure.html">interacting critical infrastructures</a> and <a href="projects/a-la-carte.html">supercomputer hardware architectures</a>. He formerly directed the <a href="projects/ieiss.html">Interdependent Energy Infrastructure Simulation System [IEISS]</a> and <a href="projects/cipdss.html">Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support System [CIPDSS]</a> projects, leading teams of approximately one dozen people, and held the position of Thrust Area Leader for the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Portfolio in its Science &amp; Technology Directorate. At LANL he was a member of its Patent Committee and its Institutional Computing Technical Committee. As a visiting scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), he initiated efforts to <a href="projects/weather-impacts.html">connect simulations of weather and climate to impact models for energy and infrastructure networks</a>.</p>
<p>Brian received a B.S. in physics at the California Institute of Technology in 1985 and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at Yale University in 1990, where he was a National Science Foundation graduate fellow. He extensively performed and published <a href="projects/physics.html">physics research on ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and nuclear shape fluctuations</a>. His research interests include statistical physics, symbolic dynamics, information theory, data mining, approximate reasoning, theory of simulation, and visualization.</p>
