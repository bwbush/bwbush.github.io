        <h1>Clustering of Cellular Automaton Traffic Microsimulation Output</h1>

        <hr/>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims/">TRANSIMS</a> microsimulation uses a cellular automata approach to provide the computational speed necessary to simulate an entire region at the individual traveler level. The cellular automata technique provides a means to simulate large numbers of vehicles and maintain a fast execution speed. Each link in the transportation network is divided into a finite number of cells. At each timestep of the simulation, each cell is examined for a vehicle occupant. If a vehicle is present in the cell, the vehicle may be advanced to another cell using a simple rule set. Increasing the fidelity by decreasing the cell size, adding vehicle attributes, and expanding the rule set results in slower computational speed. The fidelity and performance limits of the cellular automata microsimulation are evaluated to establish the computational detail required to support the fidelity necessary to meet analysis requirements.</p>

        <p>The applet below is a simple example of how the output from a cellular automaton traffic microsimulation can be classified using an automatic clustering algorithm.</p>
