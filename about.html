       	     <p>Brian W. Bush received a B.S. in physics at the California Institute of Technology in 1985 and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at Yale University in 1990, where he was a National Science Foundation graduate fellow. He extensively performed and published physics research on ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and nuclear shape fluctuations. He is currently a technical staff member in the Energy and Infrastructure Analysis Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). His work on TRANSIMS (the Transportation Analysis Simulation System) from 1994 to 2000 there focused on software architecture, the representation of road networks, microsimulation output collection, and data compression. More recently, he also developed computer simulations for complex phenomena such as interacting critical infrastructures and supercomputer hardware architectures. He formerly directed the Interdependent Energy Infrastructure Simulation System (IEISS) and Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support System (CIPDSS) projects, leading teams of approximately one dozen people. His research interests include statistical physics, symbolic dynamics, information theory, data mining, approximate reasoning, theory of simulation, and visualization. He has been a member of LANLâ€™s Patent Committee and its Institutional Computing Technical Committee. As a Visiting Scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), he has recently begun efforts to connect simulations of weather and climate to impact models for energy and infrastructure networks.</p>
