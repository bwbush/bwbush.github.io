<h3 id="principal-engineer-2008present">Principal Engineer, 2008–present</h3>
<p>National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO</p>
<p>Led the Biomass Scenario Model (BSM) project, a system-dynamics simulation of the cellulosic biomass-to-biofuels supply chain. Developed an enhanced version of the Scenario Evaluation and Regionalization Analysis (SERA), an optimization tool for regional hydrogen infrastructure. Also collaborated on statistical and geospatial analyses of renewable energy systems (photovoltaics and wind-turbine farms) from technical, financial, and economic perspectives. Researched issues around supporting community decisions in their transition to more efficient and renewable energy use. Led a data-mining and analysis-automation project that is developing new statistical and machine learning methods for application to renewable energy information.</p>
